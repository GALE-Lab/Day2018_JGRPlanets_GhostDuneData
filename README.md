This repository includes all data used to generate the figures in the publication: 
Day, M., and Catling, C., 2018, Dune casts preserved by partial burial: the first identification of “ghost dune” pits on Mars: J. Geophys. Res. Planets. Special issue.

Information in this repository includes length(m), width (m), and inferred migration direction (deg) measurements for ghost dune pits in Hellas basing and Noctis Labyrinthus, as well as the same measurements for analog dunes in Oyama crater and Herschel crater and synthetic dune pits made from these sites.
